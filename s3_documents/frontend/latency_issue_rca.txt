Incident Title: Frontend Latency and Slow Page Loads
Date: 2025-10-03
Region: AP-South-1
Service: React Frontend, CloudFront
Problem Summary:
Customers experienced slow page load times (>10s) and partial rendering failures.
Impact:
User experience degraded for 60% of sessions, primarily in India and Singapore regions.
Root Cause:
A new frontend build introduced large JavaScript bundles (~12MB) due to unoptimized dependencies.
Resolution Steps:
1. Split bundles using code-splitting.
2. Enabled CloudFront compression (gzip and brotli).
3. Reduced third-party dependencies.
Preventive Measures:
- Added Lighthouse CI performance monitoring in CI/CD pipeline.
- Scheduled periodic performance audits.
