Incident Title: API Gateway Returning 500 Errors
Date: 2025-09-28
Region: US-West-2
Service: API Gateway, Lambda
Problem Summary:
Users reported intermittent 500 Internal Server Error responses across multiple endpoints.
Impact:
Approximately 15% of API calls failed for 35 minutes.
Root Cause:
Lambda execution time exceeded due to excessive payload size after a recent schema change. The timeout setting remained at 5 seconds.
Resolution Steps:
1. Increased Lambda timeout from 5s to 15s.
2. Reduced payload size by excluding unnecessary fields.
3. Deployed caching layer for static data.
Preventive Measures:
- Added request size validation middleware.
- Introduced load testing before production deployment.
