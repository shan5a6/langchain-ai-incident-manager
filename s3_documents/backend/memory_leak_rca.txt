Incident Title: Backend Memory Leak
Date: 2025-10-18
Region: EU-Central-1
Service: Python FastAPI microservice
Problem Summary:
Memory usage gradually increased, eventually leading to OOM kill by Kubernetes.
Impact:
Service restart every 6 hours, minor request failures during restart windows.
Root Cause:
Unreleased database cursor connections in a long-running batch job.
Resolution Steps:
1. Implemented connection pooling and explicit close() for all cursors.
2. Added Prometheus memory metrics and alerts.
3. Rebuilt container image with smaller base footprint.
Preventive Measures:
- Added regression tests for memory growth.
- Scheduled weekly code quality checks.
